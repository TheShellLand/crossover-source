===============================================================================
* Major changes in release 0.30 (2007-01-05)

** Bug fixes

  man: Recode the text which is skipped, like comments.
       This kind of issue may also appear on other modules.
       A better solution would be to always use UTF-8 internally.

  distribution: Some unit tests were missing.
                Also, the dependencies have been simplified.
                Locale::gettext, Text::WrapI18N, Term::ReadKey and SGMLS
                are still recommended, but no more required.
                The BibTex module is now distributed.

  sgml: The module should be more friendly with XML files.

  po4a: When po4a creates a new PO file, it now uses msginit. This may
        change the header of created PO files.

  guide: Major update of the tag definitions. Thanks to Azamat H.
         Hackimov.

  Po: use strftime instead of date because date is not available on
      every platform.

  tests: rename the XML testsuite to SGML, since it was testing the Sgml
         module, and add a new testsuite for the Xml module (it currently
         tests the Guide module).
