	* NEWS: document the new XML test suite.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Fix minor typos in comments.
	* t/data-23/escapes1.fr.1: remove unused file

2006-12-31  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Fix a build failure with gettext 0.15:
	"invalid variable interpolation". This issue is fixed in latter
	versions of gettext, but it does not harm to fix it here.
	* Build.PL: Rework the dependencies. There are no strong
	dependencies, only recommended dependencies.
	* README: Document what happens when each dependency is missing.
	* t/01-classes.t, t/20-xml.t, t/23-man.t: Skip some tests when
	some recommended dependencies are not present.
	* MANIFEST, lib/Locale/Po4a/Chooser.pm: Distribute the BibTeX module.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Po.pm do not uses TransTractor.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm: Prepare next release.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Xml.pm: Initial support for comments in Xml.
	* t/20-xml.t, t/20-sgml.t: Rename t/20-xml.t to t/20-sgml.t.
	* t/26-ini.t: Fix a typo. It's the testsuite for the Ini module.
	* t/05-config.t, t/data-05/test0.fr.po-empty,
	t/data-05/test2.de.po-empty, t/data-05/test2.es.po-empty,
	t/data-05/test2.fr.po-empty, t/data-05/test2.it.po-empty,
	t/data-05/test7.err: Update the test suite. Po4a's behavior
	changed when it has to create a new PO file: it now uses msginit.
	* t/27-xml.t, t/data-27/general.xml, t/data-27/general.po,
	t/data-27/general-normalized.xml: New testsuite for the XML
	module.
	* NEWS: Document changes in 0.30.

2006-11-30  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* po4a: (Splitted mode) Always add the directories (for POs and
	POTs). They were missing when --force is used.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Export move_po_if_needed. Other
	subroutine are not needed. They are object's methods.
	* po4a: Import move_po_if_needed, and use it instead of
	Locale::Po4a::Po::move_po_if_needed().
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm (move_po_if_needed): Add reason for
	failures of system calls.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm (move_po_if_needed): Add a backup argument
	to specify if we want a ~ backup file.
	* po4a: Use the backup argument of move_po_if_needed: no backups
	for temp files; no backups when the no-backups option is used.
	* po4a: (Splitted mode) Always write in a temporary file, and at the
	end, move it to the final location or use move_po_if_needed. This
	was needed for the handling of backup files.
	* po4a: (Splitted mode) When we create the big merged po, if an
	header differ, the big PO's header is completely crap. So we have
	to use msgmerge -U, and we have to create a initial PO with at
	least a good header (with msggrep or msginit).
	Thanks to Azamat H. Hackimov.

2006-11-25  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm: Export new. This closes
	Alioth's bug #304168. Thanks to J.

2006-11-23  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/BibTeX.pm: Fix a typo in the documentation.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Recode skipped text. It would be better
	to always use UTF-8 internally. Other modules may suffer from the
	same issue. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux for noticing the issue on a
	man page comment.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: mdoc macros can have empty quoted
	arguments. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux for noticing.
	* po4a: Add a string for translation.
	* po4a: In splitted mode, some directories may be missing. Force
	their creation.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Chooser.pm: No need to specify every modules in
	the rewrite rules. Only indicate the modules whose name is not an
	upper case letter followed by lower case letters.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Chooser.pm: Alphabetically sort the modules in
	the list of supported modules.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Chooser.pm: Add (commented) the prospective
	modules in the list of supported modules.

2006-11-03  Azamat H. Hackimov (winterheart-guest)

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Propose the lang attribute of the
	<guide> tag for translation. This closes the Alioth's bug #304026.

2006-10-30  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Do not use the %z format with strftime,
	it is not portable. Compute our own numerical timezone.

2006-10-30  Costin Stroie  <cstroie@bitdefender.com>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Do not call date, but use strftime.

2006-10-30  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: The guide's DTD also mentions <img>
	(inline) and <subtitle> and <summary> (which can be re-wrapped).
	Also add <sub> and <sup> to translate them if they are used alone
	in a paragraph.

2006-10-30  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Read the guide DTD and test on the
	whole gentoo documentation:
	  - Translate the content of the <author>, <b>, <brite>, <c>, <e>,
	  <i>, <path>, and <uri> tags.
	  - Re-wrap the content of the <dd>, <dt>, <li>, <th>, <ti>, and
	  <title> tags.
	  - Translate the 'link' attribute of the <figure> tag.
	  - Add <brite>, <const>, <ident>, <keyword>, <mail>, <stmt>, and
	  <var> to the list of inline tags.

2006-10-30  Nobody

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Add the following tags to the 'tags'
	category: <const>, <dd>, <dt>, <ident>, <keyword>, <mail>, <stmt>,
	<var>, <version>.
	The content of these tags has to be translated.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Re-wrap the content of the <impo>,
	<note>, and <warn> tags.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Translate the 'by' parameter of the
	<p> tag.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Guide.pm: Inline the content of the <b>, <sub>
	and <sup> tags.
	These entries close Alioth's bug #304026.

2006-10-28  Azamat H. Hackimov (winterheart-guest)

	* po4a: Use msginit instead of copying the POT to the PO file.
	This closes the Alioth's bug #304039

2006-10-23  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: When an xml prologue (<?xml ...?>) is
	detected, consider '/>' as the end of XML empty tag (not an SGML
	'/' tag closure followed by an '>' character).

2006-10-22  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Remove the tags from the default
	categories when they are defined by the user.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Do not start the line references of
	included files at line #0, but at line #1.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Avoid issues with the emacs/vim perl
	parsers.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Increment the line references even when
	nsgmls do not indicate that the line changed: take into accound
	the record ends (event with type 're'). This closes Alioth's bug
	#300589 (reference for composite SGML documents not perfect).

2006-10-15  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* MANIFEST: distribute more test units. Otherwise, the test suite
	fails.

2006-10-15  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* po/pod/fr.po: Updated to 1107t1u.

2006-10-13  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* testsuite/check: Add the zZ and zY macro to include bash.1 in
	the testsuite.

2006-10-10  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: When we try to detect if a paragraph
	contains multiple bullets, quote the bullet to avoid problems with
	parenthesis.

2006-10-09  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: The module generated additional empty
	lines.  Better handling of empty paragraphs (empty line followed
	by another one).
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Add support for underlined text.
	Translate a title together with the underlining, in non wrapped
	mode.  Underlines are lines consisting in only '=', '-' or '_'.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Consider paragraphs with more than 3
	consecutive spaces as non-wrapped paragraphs.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Consider paragraphs starting by a
	bullet ('*') or numberred paragraphs ('1)' or '2.') as non-wrapped
	paragraphs.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm (translate): When the wrapcol
	argument is negative, add the default wrapcol value.  NOTE: It
	does not take into account the argument of the po4a-translate's
	--width option.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Support for bulleted paragraphs:
	extract the bullet's text, and wrap/reindent after translation.
	A -o nobullets option was added to revert this behavior.
	* NEWS: Document these changes.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Support consecutive bulleted
	paragraphs, without empty line to separate them.

2006-10-08  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* NEWS: document important changes in 0.29.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm: Prepare release 0.29.

2006-10-08  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* po/bin/po4a.pot, po/pod/po4a-pod.pot: Regerated.
	* po/bin/*.po, po/pod/*.po: Synchronized with the POTs.

2006-10-08  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Add an "mdoc" option to select a
	stricter support for mdoc (no translation of the 'NAME' section).

2006-10-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* po4a-normalize: Beginning of support for reading stdin.
	More work is needed for a full support (other options, other
	tools, module should not read the file twice, how to deal with
	inclusion, ...).
	* po4a-gettextize: Likewise.

2006-10-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Add 'term' to the verbatim tags. This
	is needed for the module-assistant sgml man page. Otherwise,
	lists' items are not indented.

2006-10-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Fix the issue detected in the previous
	changes (mdoc.fr). When a line was wrapped inside a E<.xx ...>,
	the end of line was replaced by a space instead of just being
	deleted.
	* t/data-23/mdoc.fr: Fix the testsuite accordingly.

2006-10-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Fix another wrap / length calculation
	issue, this time for the generation of the PO.
	* t/data-23/mdoc.fr: Needed by the previous change. The mdoc code
	needs a fix.

2006-10-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* t/data-23/mdoc.fr: This is needed by the previous change.  This
	probably means there is minor issue in the handling of E<.xx ...>.

2006-09-24  Yuri Kozlov  <kozlov.y@gmail.com>
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm: Convert UTF-8 strings to Perl's "logical
	character" before wrapping the text. This helps the length
	calculation needed for wrapping lines.

2006-09-18  Stephane Blondon  <stephane.blondon@laposte.net>

	* po/pod/fr.po: Fix a typo.

2006-09-18  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Do not reopen the input file.
	Otherwise, it fails when the master document is stdin.

2006-09-17  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Add \N'xxx' to the exception for the ''
	to \*(rq transliteration. Thanks to KISE Hiroshi for pointing
	this.

2006-09-14  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Move <cmdsynopsis> from the indent to the
	verbatim category.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Move <arg> and <option> from the
	translate to the ignore.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Sgml.pm: Fix the handling of verbatim sections.
	Better spacing (some end of line were missing).

2006-09-05  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* t/23-man.t, t/data-23/spaces, t/data-23/spaces.fr_latin1,
	t/data-23/spaces.fr_latin1.po, t/data-23/spaces.fr_utf8,
	t/data-23/spaces.fr_utf8.po, t/data-23/spaces.ja,
	t/data-23/spaces.ja.po, t/data-23/spaces.pot: New test for an
	issue pointed by KISE Hiroshi.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: ? was considered as a non breaking
	space. Activate the detection of failing Encode::from_to().
	Thanks to KISE Hiroshi for pointing it.
	* t/data-23/fonts.en, t/data-23/fonts.pot: Fix the test suite:
	"empty commented lines" are kept.
	* t/data-23/mdoc.fr: Fix the test suite: "spaces at the
	end of the line for blocks of text" are removed.

2006-08-30  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/BibTeX.pm: Change what appears in the 'type'
	comment of the msgid (in the PO).

2006-08-29  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/BibTeX.pm: New module: support for BibTeX
	bibliographies.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Text.pm: Fix a typo in a comment.

2006-08-27  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Keep empty commented lines.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: wrap keeps spaces at the end of
	empty lines. Remove the space at the end of the line for blocks of
	text (it should be done in some other blocks,but at least, it seems
	safe here).

2006-08-27  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* t/data-23/mixed.cfg, t/data-23/mixed.pot, t/data-23/mixed.fr.po,
	t/data-23/mixed1, t/data-23/mixed1.fr, t/data-23/mixed2,
	t/data-23/mixed2.fr, t/data-23/mixed3, t/data-23/mixed3.fr,
	t/data-23/mixed4, t/data-23/mixed.4.fr, t/23-man.t: New mixed
	test. Avoid depending on files used by other tests.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: remove re_init() and detect the end of
	file when there are no more lines in parse().

2006-08-26  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Reorganize the list of options: all the
	options to specify the behaviour of new options together.

2006-08-23  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* MANIFEST: Distribute the INI module.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Chooser.pm: Add the 'ini' module alias.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Ini.pm: Little cleanup. Remove references to
	Pod::Parser.
	* t/26-ini.t, t/data-26/test1.ini, t/data-26/test1.po: Add a test
	to the testsuite for the ini module.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Call re_init only once, in docheader.
	When it was called in the .TH and .Dd macros, it used to remove
	the comments at the beginning (e.g. copyright notice, preprocessor
	indications, etc.

2006-08-21  Costin Stroie <cstroie@bitdefender.com>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Ini.pm: New module for .INI files.

2006-08-20  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: (mdoc) Only remove the spaces at the end
	of an mdoc macros if the space is not escaped.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Do not always change '' to \*(rq.
	For example, Pod::Man uses \*' and this sequence may be followed by a
	single quote.

2006-08-17  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* po/bin/po4a.pot, po/pod/po4a-pod.pot: Regerated.
	* po/bin/*.po, po/pod/*.po: Synchronized with the POTs.
	* po/pod/fr.po: Updated to 1088t1u.
	* t/data-05/test7.err: Update due to the change in po4a.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm, debian/changelog: Prepare the

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/LaTeX.pm: Add a link to the TeX module man page.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TeX.pm: Register the environment provided by
	the -o verbatim or -o no_wrap option, if the environment does not
	already exist.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TeX.pm: Document the
	'% po4a: verbatim environment I<env>' inline command.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TeX.pm: When no parameters are specified in a
	'% po4a: environment I<env> I<parameters>', do not expect a
	trailing space.
	* t/data-23/mdoc.1, t/data-23/mdoc.fr, t/data-23/mdoc.pot,
	t/data-23/mixed.fr.po, t/data-23/mixed.pot: Add a test for font
	modifiers nested in mdoc commands.

	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm, t/data-23/fonts.en, t/data-23/fonts.pot:
	Fix the above tests.
	* po4a: Only read a PO once. It was read for every master file of
	the configuration file.
	* NEWS: Add a NEWS file.

2006-08-07  Nicolas François  <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net>

	* scripts/po4aman-display-po: If man -aw find multiple manpages
	(e.g. ls.1 and ls.1posix), but only one exactly matches the given
	section, use this page. Thanks to Florentin Duneau for reporting.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: The "do not force the translators to
	translate them if the line only consists in \&, spaces and font
	modifiers." patch was wrong. Some strings could be untranslated if
	a (multi-line) string contained a line with only font modifiers,
	\& and spaces..
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/Man.pm: Last patch fixing "Keep the \\f font
	modifiers with the inline macros' arguments (E<...>)." was wrong.
	Add missing $ at the end of the regex.
	* lib/Locale/Po4a/TransTractor.pm: Update VERSION to 0.27.2.

po4a (0.27.1-1)

  [Nicolas François]
  (po/pod/fr.po)
  * Fix unterminated S<...>

 -- Fri,  4 Aug 2006 23:25:25 +0200
po4a (0.27-1)

  [Nicolas François]
  (html-build-upload.sh)
  * Generate the manpages before the convertion to html (the line was
    commented)
  (Text.pm)
  * Fix missing empty lines between paragraphs.
  (Man.pm)
  * Sometimes, the .B or .I macros are followed by an argument which only
    consist in a space. As the .B or .I macro is replaced by \fB or \fI,
    the quotes are removed, and some \& must be used to keep the space
    (otherwise the line will be considered empty by groff.
    Add these \&, and do not force the translators to translate them if
    the line only consists in \&, spaces and font modifiers.
  * Support for the ms' DA macro.
  * Support commented lines between .ie and .el macros.
  * Keep quotes arround mdoc macros' arguments when they contain spaces.
  * Do not replace - by \- in the symbols used in \*(XX
  * When we warn about using conditionnals without groff_code, also show
    the reference of the line.
  * gettextize the ".ie without .el" error, and add the reference of the
    line in the manpage.
  * add an mdoc method (translate_mdoc_no_quotes) because some mdoc macros
    must not have their arguments quoted.
  * In splitargs, change \&" to a groff double quote \(dq.
    It's still not perfect, but it helps in a lot of pages.
  * When a string is quoted, only translate the argument between the
    quotes, and restore the quotes latter.
  * Keep the \\f font modifiers with the inline macros' arguments (E<...>).
  * Add \\f in the "Unsupported font in..." error. This helps understanding
    what/where is the error.
  * Fix typos.
  (po4a)
  * Print the number of translated strings, even if the translation is
    discarded because it is less translated than the threshold.
  (po4aman-display-po)
  * Do not always use po4a-translate's -o options for the options passed
    to po4aman-display-powith -o. Otherwise, we can only specify module
    options, and not options for po4a-translate (i.e. we can't specify
    something like -o "-L ISO-8859-1").
  (Tex.pm)
  * Fix typos.
  (po/bin/fr.po)
  * Update the translation, after review by the Debian l10n list.
  (po/pod/fr.po)
  * Update the translation, after review by the Debian l10n list.

  [Florentin Duneau]
  (po/pod/fr.po)
  * Fix some typos.

  [Thomas Huriaux]
  (Man.pm)
  * Support for empty .B or .I followed by commands, with a warning.

 -- Sun,  9 Jul 2006 01:19:52 +0200

po4a (0.26-1)

  [Nicolas François]
  (po4aman-display-po)
  * When the master page is not provided, only look for the English man page.
  * With -m, users can now just specify the name of the original manpage
    (without the full path). Thanks to Florentin Duneau.
  * Warn if the -m argument not sufficient to identify an unique man page
    (the section is needed). Thanks to Florentin Duneau.
  * Do not use the function keyword (yields a syntax error with dash).
    Thanks to Julien Cristau.
  * Add missing quotes
  * Fix the trap command
  (Man.pm)
  * Fix failures when a configuration file is used to translate both mdoc
    and groff man pages. The groff macros are no more erased in mdoc mode.
  * When a TH macro is found, switch back to the groff mode (but keep the
    mdoc macros if they were defined).
  * Print the po4a header before the Dd macros.
  * .SM is an inline macro. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Add support for \# groff comments. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Specify the line reference for "Unsupported font" errors.
  * Allow some more \c escapes (still not supported everywhere)
  * Reset some memories at the beginning of files (docheader & .TH & .Dd).
    When multiple files were mentionned in a config file, the comments or
    the fonts from one document could affect the next file.
  * Fix the .IX macro.
  * Support the \fL font modifier (needed for .IX).

  * Only warn for .so and .mso, and do not translate the line.
  * Fix some bugs related to quotes used in the arguments of groff macros.
  * Do not split the arguments to the .ie, .if, .de macros. This fixes
    some spacing and quote issues with these macros.
  * el lines can start with a apostrophe (') instead of a period (.).
  * .el macros can be followed by a space or an escaped curly bracket (\{).
  * always convert back non breaking spaces to '\ ' before pushing the
    arguments in splitargs().
  * Do not convert non breaking spaces before calling splitargs.
    (otherwise, the error mesages do not contain the original string)
  (Chooser.pm)
  * Fix a typo in the LaTeX module link and add the Xml module to the
    SEE ALSO section.
  (Sgml.pm)
  * Add the docbook's edition tag to the translate category.

  * Add some quote tests for the Man module.
  (html-build-upload.sh)
  * Update the script to build the html documentation. It now uses
    man2html. (This was necessary for the Polish pages)
  (po4a)
  * Use the same order as in the configuration file when creating the POT
    and the translated files.
    NOTE: this may modify the order of strings in your current POTs.

po4a (0.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  New upstream release (no change in packaging):
  
  [Nicolas François]
  (Po.pm)
  * Missing =back in the pod part.
  * consecutive escaped tabulations in the PO: only the first one was
    un-escaped. Closes: #359352
  * gettextize: do not associate the strings by their order in the POs, but by
    their order in the documents. This permits to gettextize documents
    which have the same structure, but where a string have
    multiple translations, or when different strings have the same translation.
    If multiple translations appear for a string, both strings are proposed in
    the PO. Closes: #326670
  (po4a)
  * When a master document is specified twice in a configuration file:
    - do not ignore the options specified in the first line;
    - also warn in this case since po4a may not do what the user wants.
  * Fix the documentation: po4a do not use the POT-Creation-Date field of the
    POT and PO headers. It only updates the POs with msgmerge -U.
    Closes: #360141
  (Man.pm)
  * Documentation: this module is no more beta.
  * Another fix for "when a font modifier if followed by another font
    modifier". Also add a test for this case.
  * mdoc support.
  * Do not put the header at the top of the file, but just before the .TH
    macro. This will preserve the indications on how to process the page if
    the first line contains something like: '\" t
  (Xml.pm)
  * Implement placeholders: this permits to specify that footnotes must not be
    translated inside a paragraph, but are translated separately and a
    <placeholder0> tag will be put where the footnote must be installed.
  * In tag_extract_doctype, we can't test whether the Document Type Definition
    contains an Internal Subset by searching the document for "]>" because
    this is also used for closing the CDATA Sections.  This caused
    segmentation faults.  Closes: #362169
  * get_string_until: add a option to search a regular expression.  The
    default is to search for a fixed string.  Also make sure get_string_until
    works when the serach string (or regex) contains a newline (\n).
  * When there is an Internal Subset, the Document Type Definition ends with
    "]\s*>", not necessarily "]>".
  * Add support for CDATA Sections.
  (po4aman-display-po)
  * new script to display a translated man page with a given PO.
    Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  (po4a.7.pod)
  * Fix a typo in the detailed example for the beginboundary field.
    Thanks to Ognyan Kulev.

po4a (0.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Nicolas François]
  (Sgml.pm)
  * Preserve more entities. It was already the case for entities ending by a
    semi-colon, but they were expended in entities not terminated by a
    semi-colon (e.g. id="&url-debian-volatile").
  * Add the docbook docinfo tag, and remove duplicate refsect1 tag.
  * Add a post-translation filter, which converts non breaking spa¢es (0xA0 in
    latin1) to the &nbsp; entity.
  (Po.pm)
  * use File::Copy::move instead of rename (the POT/POs were not written when
    /tmp and the file were not in the same device.
    Thanks to Valéry Perrin and Thomas Huriaux. Closes: 354330
  * make filter() less verbose
  * delete the automatically generated apply subroutine to avoid warnings.
  * be more restrictive on the lines ignored by diff in write_if_needed.
  * New function move_po_if_needed to move a PO if there are some chnages.
  (TeX.pm)
  * Do not extract a trailing command if it is followed by an unexpected
    parameter. This fixes an issue in list environments when the \item are
    followed by blocks. Closes: 354955
  * New verbatim environment category. You can now specify verbatim blocks in
    environments other than "verbatim".
  (po4a)
  * The --split option is no more needed. This feature is supported by using
    $master in the po4a_paths line.
  * try to re-generate the POT if the config file was modified.
  * use File::Copy instead of system("cp").
  (general)
  * replace some `||' by `or'. || has an higher priority and some warnings
    were masked.
  (Pod.pm)
  * Overload the TransTractor's translate() in order to add pre- and
    post-translation filters.
  * Change the latin1 0xA0 (non-breaking spaces) to the pod S<...> equivalent.
    This should help projects with multiple formats.
  (Man.pm)
  * .R is a (R), not a font modifier.
  * Remove duplicate definition of the .P macro. The font was not reset to
    Roman.
  * Also handle empty font modifiers followed by .P, .PP, .LP or .TP
  * When a font modifier if followed by another font modifier (or .P, or .SH,
    etc.), the first font must not be ignored. Inform the font stack with
    set_font.
  * a .P or .TP may be followed by spaces.
  * Remove unneded group in regex (theoretical speedup).
  * Detect non-wrapped lines (lines starting by spaces) when the line starts
    by a font modifier (\f).
  (README.maintainers)
  * Add a document to help the translators.
    Thanks to the contributions from Denis Barbier, Thomas Huriaux and Cyril
    Brulebois.
  (MANIFEST)
  * Distribute the ar, eo, eu, he, ku, nb, nl, pt, pt_BR, sl, sv and uk
    translations since some of them have more translated strings than other
    alredy distributed.

  [Yuri Kozlov]
  * Updated russian translation (po/bin/ru.po) (Closes: #350300)

po4a (0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Thomas Huriaux]
  (po4a)
  * only updates the POT if a master document is more recent than the existing
    POT. Closes: #339459
  * New --variable option.
  (Docbook.pm)
  * refentrytitle can be specified inside a sentence. Move this tag to the
    inline category.
  (Sgml.pm)
  * There can be spaces between the entity definition and '>'.
  * Some fixes in the line references counting mechanism.
  * Add a ignore-inclusion option. It permits to avoid including external
    entities.
  * For the conditionnal inclusions, use the <po4abeg name="..."> and
    <po4aend> tags to fool nsgml instead of the {PO4A-beg-...} and {PO4A-end},
    which caused extra tags to be added by nsgmls.
  * Do not fail when the file pointed by a system entity does not exist and
    this entity is not used.

  [Nicolas François]
  (Po.pm)
  * If a line could not be wrapped (e.g. because of a more than xx chars
    link), the rest of the paragraph was not rewrapped.
    Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Add a write_if_needed subroutine to check if an update is needed.
    see #339459.
  (Text.pm)
  * A new very simple module for text documents. Closes: #243753
  (po4a-gettextize)
  * support for multiple master/localized files. Closes: #319208
  (Sgml.pm)
  * Do not re-wrap the prolog entities on one line.
  * An external entity can be referenced as &entity; or &entity. The second
    case is now supported. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Do not include the commented entities.
  * support for the 'qref' tag.
  * Support for the processing instructions (pi) (e.g. <?xml...?>).
  * Fix various issues when po4a is not run in the master file directory.
  (Xml.pm)
  * The inline tags were not added to the tags path. It should now be possible
    to put "<tag1><tag2>" in the 'tags' category, even if <tag1> is in the
    'inline' category.
  * The encoding declaration must be added before any standalone document
    declaration. Otherwise the document is not valid. Thanks to Olivier
    Trichet for noticing.
  * First attempt to translate the entities.
  (Docbook.pm)
  * When a tag is added to the 'inline' or 'tags' category on the command
    line, the default tags in Docbook.pm should not add this tag in the other
    ('inline' or 'tags') category.
  * New "nodefault" option, to avoid a specified tag to be set in the tags
    or inline category by defaut.
  (po4a)
  * Add a set of options that could be useful for the maintainers:
    --no-translations, --rm-translations, --no-backups, --rm-backups
  * Add a --force option that force the re-generation of the POT and PO files.
  * If the POT is updated (see Thomas change above), check that this update is
    really needed (avoids changing only the POT-Creation-Date field).
    see #339459.
  * The error message when msgmerge failed was wrong. Closes: #339453
  * Fix the --quiet option. CLoses: #342293
    Thanks to Brendan O'Dea.
  (translations)
  * Update French translation, use non-breaking spaces where needed
  * Fix a lot of typos in the French translation. Thanks to Frédéric Bothamy.
    Closes: #341175
  * Update the Swedish translation according to Rosetta
    (I can't update more languages. The update process of Rosetta is ways too
    complicated)

  [Danilo Piazzalunga]
  * Update Italian program translation.

  [Robert Luberda]
  * Program and manpages translation to Polish. Closes: #340877
  (Build.PL)
  * Fix of the build script for the languages that don't use latin1 for their
    man pages.

  * Append the content of a CDATA to the current buffer because it was
    not output at the right position
  * Don't forget some {PO4A-beg/end} in the output document
  * Ignore (ie, remove) <![ IGNORE [...]]> sections
  * recognize numerical character entities (e.g. &#38;)
    Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Improve speed 
  * use the nsgmls -wno-valid option to avoid some errors since we include
    all parts conditional inclusion constructs, for example.
  * fix the spacing of the verbatim blocks.
    Thanks to Julien Louis (ptitlouis) for reporting.
  * Various other little fixes and improvements
  (Man module)
  * Fix the .ds macro (it arguments must be translated, except the name of the
    variable, which must be dispalyed to the translator)

    supported by po4a (untranslated, noarg, translate_joined,
    translate_each, no_wrap, inline)
  (TeX & LaTeX modules)
  * New syntax for the "% po4a:" line.
    This alow command to mix optional and mandatory arguments.
  * remove the old category (untranslated, translate_each, ...) This was
    problematic when a command is follwed by a block ({...}).
  * Update the definition of the common LaTeX commands and environments.
    All these definitions are now in the LaTeX module.
  * Allow 3 mode of separation for the commands at an extremity of a block
    (separate and translate the parameters that must be translated
    separately, separate and translate the command with its parameters, only
    separate if the command is alone in a block).
  * Allow to translate the \begin command with all its arguments attached.
  * Make error messages translatable.

    This needed a minor correction of Pod.pm and Sgml.pm.
  (Debian package)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.6.2
  * do not build depend on libsgmls-perl
  * depends on ${misc:depends}, ${perl:Depends} instead of perl | perl5

    to the path of the master Sgml file.
    Fixes bug #300874 on the Alioth tracker, for the Sgml module.
  * The debug option is a space separated list of channels to print
    information for. So we must split it to set $debug.
  * Check the nsgmls exit code and issue an error if it is non-zero.
    This lets us detect the case where nsgmls is missing.
  * Add support for translating attribute values.
  * Add a 'qualify' option to denote which attributes should get an
    msgid 'qualified' by the attribute name.
  * Don't qualify the lang attribute by default for consistency with Xml.pm

    - permits to build derivated parsers (e.g. for LaTeX, but texinfo is also
      planned);
    - allows personnalization (with '% po4a: ' lines in the tex file or a class
      file);
    - handles file inclusion.
    - customization by categories of commands
      (translated/untranslated and/or separated).

    convert them to ISO-8859-1 for now so that generated manual pages
    also have this encoding.  Closes: #273736
  * [po/bin/it.po & po/pod/it.po] Convert PO files back to UTF-8. Thanks to
    Jordi and everybody else for fixing the charset issues.

po4a (0.18.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency set to high to have a chance for 0.18 to enter testing.
    This version has been much more tested than 0.17 and many bugs
    fixed; they were not filed on the BTS because only its developers
    are currently using po4a, but 0.18 is mature enough for a larger
    audience.

  [Jordi Vilalta]
  - [Xml.pm] Improved attributes matching when there's no tag hierarchy in
    front of an attribute
  [Denis Barbier]
  - A header comment is inserted by po4a-translate with some formats,
    remove po4a version number from this comment so that test files do
    not have to be updated at every release.

po4a (0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Jordi Vilalta]
  - [Build.PL] Ensure we run the tests before distributing a new release
  - Added encoding support (not complete by now)
  - [Xml.pm] Added the generic XML support module
  - [Dia.pm] Changed to use Xml.pm
  - [tests] Updated most tests to work with the encoding issues
  - [documentation] General improvements
  - [translation] sync to en po/bin/es.po, po/bin/ca.po and po/pod/es.po
    with small improvements suggested by Carme Cirera
  - [Guide.pm] Added Guide XML support module
  
  [Martin Quinson]
  (generic)
  - Fix several typo in messages.
    - po4a: inverting the meaning. Closes #264535 in Debian
    - po4a-updatepo: was rather poor. Closes #264537 in Debian
    - Sgml.pm: induced a perl error (not enough args for format).
      Thanks Olivier Trichet for the last one, and Danilo for the others.
  - Various documentation & messages improvements
  - [translation] Update po/bin/fr.po
  (TransTractor)
  - Do not try (and fail miserably) to create path to output file when it's
    in the current directory (also in Po.pm).
  - [addendum] change a 'while (shift @toto) {}' to a 
    'do {shift; bla} while (scalar @toto)' so that we proceed even if @toto
    contains empty strings. (Clauses: #265383) of Debian
  (Sgml)
  - stop pushline()ing empty strings since it breaks TransTractor. Also
    closes Debian's #265383. Yup, this bug is fixed twice. Slam!
  (Man)
  - Fix tests so that they stop make sure that the nf/fi bug of man is still
    there. Test that it does not come back instead.
  - Convert on the fly the groff horror \*(lqlibc5\*(rq, which stands for
    "libc5", with the quotes. Thanks to Phillipe Batailler for bringing my
    attention to this.
  - Add support for the groff builtin registers and for the ms
    "Displays and keeps" macros. This was needed to deal with the man pages
    of shadow and dpkg.
  - No groff nbsp (ie '\ ') on the last pos of the line, or groff adds an
    extra space. Thanks to Nicolas Francois for the info. 
  - Convert \- to - on the fly. The asteatic of the printed man page may
    suffer (a hyphen is different of a minus sign in ps/pdf), but makes
    translator's life easier. Thanks to Nicolas Francois for the expertise.
  - Stick to groff_man(7) intead of man(7), and consider that when IP is
    given only one argument, that's the designator (which we have to
    translate) instead of the column indentation. Thanks Francois.
  - Deal properly with '\ ' in macro arguments. Ie, stop changing 
    '.BI -a\  addresses' to '.BI "-a addresses"' (but to .BI "-a " addresses)
  - Do not eat \ at the end of the line (and put the next one on the same
    line) when we're not on a macro definition line.
  (po4a)
  - Kill the code checking that the first argument contains no colon, since
    the filename can contain colons. This triggers false positives here.
    Thanks to Julien Louis for reporting. (Closes: #265684).

po4a (0.17.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Martin Quinson]
  - new script: msgsearch to extract some messages from a po file. That's a
    generalization of msggrep allowing you to use OR between different
    categories. msgselect is "reserved" by gettext author to do the same using
    the SQL syntax in input. I use the LDAP one (with Perl RE ;).
  - [sgml] add refentry to verbatim so that no spaces are added.
  - [sgml] do not indent neither add superious spaces around verbatim tags
    Those two should Closes #262739 (in Debian).
  - [sgml] Allow entities def. to contain '>'. Closes #262735 (in Debian)
  - [documentation] Overhaul of po4a(7)
  - [documentation] Various pod fixup
  - TransTractor and Po mkdir the path to where they are asked to write
    something if it does not exist. Closes #263297 (in Debian)
  - [addendum] Allow extra space after the semi colon separating fields in
    headers. Closes #263299 (in Debian, provided that I understood the repport)
  - [sgml] Allow %entities; in prolog, even if they are the evil incarned on
    earth. Damn it, it wasn't easy. Fixes Alioth's #300710.
  - [sgml] Detect when the included files do not exist, and spit the right
    error message
  - [translation] keep po/bin/fr.po in sync with the code, despite my own
    effort to fuzzy the strings (I mean improve them, of course)

  [Jordi Vilalta]
  - [documentation] Further pod and english fixup
  - [translation] Complete the spanish translation of the documentation
  - Non-intrusive modifications to Po.pm and TransTractor.pm to help support
    the encoding options in the near future
  - [translation] sync to en po/bin/es.po and po/bin/ca.po

     the translation ;)
   - fix several brain dead errors in po4a (I swear I tested version 0.17 !)
   - add a threshold option to po4a(1). If we cannot set it from the config
     file, at least we can set it from the command file.
   - Fix Man module:
     - add support for the .na and .nh roff macro (ignored). Closes alioth's
       #300845, and allows to tackle apt-proxy(8).
     - .nf stops wrapping; .fi starts it again. The contrary was done.

  SGML should work. Without source change, even for (simple) XML.
  Addition of a Dia module by Jordi Vilalta.
  
  Martin Quinson
  * [all binaries]
    - add a -o/--option flag allowing to pass options to the format plugin
  * [Sgml.pm] 
    - Try to handle XML documents, with a big fat warning that this may fail,
      and that no bug should be reported if it does not work.
      Thanks to Jordi Vilalta for suggesting that.
    - New options to add tags to the mechanism without modifying the code.
    - Detect non-master files and report them properly. This was alioth's
      #300591 and savannah's #6438.
    - Put verbatim tags in their own msgid to avoid issues with
      mixing wrapped and non-wrapped. This was savannah's #7155.
    - Make a gentle error message when SGMLS.pm was not found.
    - Issue warnings ("hello, user. This is a feature") when msgid is
      skipped because it contains an entity alone, or because it contains
      only tags. The translation of those is always the msgid itself. 
      Thanks Jordi for falling into that trap ;)
    - Detect msgid containing one entity and spaces, and skip them also.
    - Add a 'include-all' option preventing the optimization described on
      two previous items.
    - Permit the translation of entity definition (not for file including
      ones, but for the rewrite ones). Thanks Jordi for the hint.
    - Add missing tags (articleinfo, which was savannah's #8475, and some more)
  * Fix a bunch of typos reported by Francois Gouget (thanks). 
    This was savannah's #7152.
  * [t/data-02/man.po] back to 100% success on tests
    Reformatting to match what we get. This does not impact the semantic of
    the file, and I believe the change is due to gettext.
  * [t/data-20/*; t/20-xml.t] New test about SGML plugin (when used in XML
    mode since it tests both modes at once)
  * [po/bin/fr.po] Complete translation. 
    [po/pod/fr.po] Complete translation of binaries man page.
    I reviewed the strings in the process and fixed some of them.

  Denis Barbier
  * Call 'xgettext -L Perl' instead of '-L c' to extract messages from

    to follow GNU usage.
  * As told in section 3.1 of the Perl policy, man pages must be installed
    under section 3pm, not 3perl.
  * In debian/rules, remove the useless pods target, 'make -C po' does the
    job.
  * Make debian/rules much lighter by processing and running Makefile.PL
  * Normalize po4a-normalize, replace --help-fmt command-line flag by
    --help-format to comply with other po4a tools.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Chooser, all available formats were loaded, the
    requested one is now dynamically loaded.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Pod, remove declarations of functions when they
    are inherited from Locale::Po4a::TransTractor.
  * Some newlines were missing with the POD format, because trailing
    newlines were removed in Locale::Po4a::Pod, and some (but not all)
    were added in Locale::Po4a::Po.  These changes are removed, and
    po4a-normalize does no more lose newlines on POD files.

  * Fix the small glitches which made the tests to fail.

  * Add a 'no-wrap' flag to all msgid which must not be wrapped by
    po4a. This tag is valid for gettext and will be preserved by
    tools. It means something else for gettext, but this other meaning seems
    useless to me, and both uses can coexist.

    - first release.
    - seems ok to me (it fails on unknown macro, and shouldn't change the
      cat result).

po-pod (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the new Locale::Po4a::TransTractor as base of the parser/extractor.

po-pod (0.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on the newly created liblocale-po4a-perl, and do not provide
    Po.pm anymore.

po-pod (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-gettextize:
    - output file defaults to standard output.
    - document the fact that all translations found during the merge are
      marked fuzzy, and why. 

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 17:22:58 +0100

po-pod (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove {read,write} to filehandle to avoid problems when running under
    UTF8 locales.
  * Po.pm: when calling the regular gettext, prefix it with
    Locale::gettext::, so that we get the function we are looking for, and
    not the one defined in this package.

po-pod (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-translate:
    - when a translation is discarded, remove the old generated file.

po-pod (0.8) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Po.pm:
    - New functions: gettext_stats, and gettext_stats_clear. Be careful
      (and read the doc ;), it's not the status of the file, it's the
      summary of its recent use through the gettext method.
    - New function: wrapped_gettext(), wrapped_push(), which do like 
      gettext() and push(), but assumes that whitespaces in msgid and 
      msgstr are not significant (and modify them).
  * pod-updatepo: INCOMPATIBLE INTERFACE CHANGE!
    - now accepts several pod files (to put their translation in only one
      file per language).  
  * pod-translate:
    - reports how much is each file translated when running verbose.
    - New option: -k set the threshold under what the translation is
      discarded. Defaults to 80. 
    - New option: -w set the width to which the resulting file should be
      wrapped. Defaults to 76.
    - New option: -a|--add-file is implemented (see man page). It's not
      specific to pod files, and should work for all modules, provided
      that they keep the file to output in a @ of lines.
  * Packaging:
    - Perl modules are now stored under /usr/share, and not /usr/lib
      because they are not arch-dependent.
    - Manpages are now installed only with dh_installman, so that we don't  
      get them twice.
    - The comments in source also says that code is GPL'ed
  * All binaries and modules:
    use (regular) gettext.pm to localize the messages ;)
