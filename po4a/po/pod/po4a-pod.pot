"So, the whole point of po4a is to make the documentation translation "
"I<maintainable>. The idea is to reuse the gettext methodology to this new "
"field. Like in gettext, texts are extracted from their original locations in "
"order to be presented in a uniform format to the translators. The classical "
"gettext tools help them updating their works when a new release of the "
"original comes out. But to the difference of the classical gettext model, "
"the translations are then re-injected in the structure of the original "

"Thanks to this, discovering which parts of the document were changed and "

"split. By extracting the text to translate from the document structure, it "
"also keeps you away from the text formatting complexity and reduces your "
